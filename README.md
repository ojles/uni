# University Projects

* [Cpp Programming](cpp-programming) - contains two projects - [DataStructures](cpp-programming/DataStructures) that implements
linked list and binary tree with custom iterator `miterator` and pretty print. Also [ProgrammingLanguage](cpp-programming/ProgrammingLanguage)
that implements a compiler that processes a simplified C-like programming language to assemby-like language which is
then run by a virtual machine.
