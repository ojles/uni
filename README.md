# University Projects

* [Cpp Programming](cpp-programming) - contains two projects - [DataStructures](cpp-programming/DataStructures)
that implements linked list and binary tree with custom iterator `miterator` and pretty print.
Also [ProgrammingLanguage](cpp-programming/ProgrammingLanguage) that implements a compiler that
processes a simplified C-like programming language to assemby-like language which is
then run by a virtual machine.

* [Unix Programming](unix-programming) - contains two simple tasks
in various programming laguages (C, java, bash, python, perl, C#)

* [Image Processing](image-processing) - contains three tasks on the topic of image processing.
The first task is about image formats and compression methods. The second task implements different
edge detection algorithms. In the third task we implement a simple banner using Macromedia Flash.

* [Data Mining](data-mining) - implements fuzzy clustering algorithm, contains presentation and
paper explaining this algorithm. The algorithm is based on this repository:
[yclicc/FLAME-python](https://github.com/yclicc/FLAME-python)
