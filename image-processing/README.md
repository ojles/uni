# Image Processing

### [Task 1](task1)

* compress 24-bit BPM using RLE alhorothm
* convert fitrst image to TIFF and compress with LZW algorithm
* convert firhst image to JPEG using standard encoding
* compare image sizes
* calculate the image quality loss of JPEG by subtracting JPEG image from the
  original BPM image pixel by pixel
* visualize this subtraction
* calculate read, write, encode and decode time for each image format and
  compression type

### [Task 2](task2)

* apply equalization on image and compare histograms of the resulting image
  and the original image
* apply edge detection algorithms:
    * Roberts cross
    * Sobel operator
    * Prewitt operator

### [Task 3](task3)

* create any banner using Macromedia Flash
